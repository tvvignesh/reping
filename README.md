======

A utility to keep the internet connection alive for ION users.

To edit the code, you have to start with the c sharp file and edit or add functions inside.

The ahk file (autohotkey file) is in integration with c sharp file but it must be first converted into exe after edit using ahk2exe and then named the same way as mentioned in the .cs file.

The ahk file does the interaction with the browser and .cs file does the interaction with the users..
